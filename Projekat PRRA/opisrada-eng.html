    Working on this project was as interesting as the toughest &#128514. Not tough in terms of boring, but very extensive. In any case, working with HTML is very interesting, especially for those who intend to work with marker and WEB languages and of course, those who have a part of themselves who want to deal with art, besides IT. Why? So with HTML and a little CSS, you can create a decent website, even if you know JavuScript, described on this site, your possibilities are unlimited. But, of course, you have to start from the beginning, watch thousands of tutorials, and read a lot of books on this topic to get some basic knowledge. E and then ... <br> ... then new HTML is created qnd some new Java framework and you are back in the beginning &#128546 <br>
   <br><img class="het" src="ht.jpg" alt=htm><br><br>
   It's so in the IT industry, it's always new to come out and surprise you, just when you thought you had learned almost everything. <br>
        But that should not discourage anyone, on the contrary, if your work is interesting in HTML like me, sit well and work, read, watch tutorials <br> create a website with as many elements and effects as possible. In this way, you will gain knowledge and do a nice thing.
        <br>The work on this project was strenuous, but above all encouraging.
    <br>
    <br>
    So sit and work and it will be a greaat!!! &#128523 &#128521 &#128540<br>
    PS:Some of the pictures, texts and files from website are downloaded from internet.<br>
    PSPS:If english translation is not so good don't mind please &#128522
